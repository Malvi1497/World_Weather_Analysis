# Overview
In this project we had created a map that allowed the user to apply his desired criteria to describ his potential locations for travel. We had used google API's to define preffered destinations.

This task was performed by generating a list of random latitudes and longitudes and the nearest cities using the citypy module. With the help of OpenWeatherMap API to get current data related to weather from each city and then the resulting map porvides the users with descriptions of destinations found in the list.
